Just a few notes on league play, we will be following ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ with a few modifications:

* Two handed sets over the net allowed
* Subs from other teams permissible if opposing team approves
* Underhand contact below the wrist (such as an upwards slap) prohibited in advanced.
* Subs must come in at the server (1) position on the serve
* Late players (not subbing in, but filling in their team's floor space) may join the game in their position but not during a live rally.
* The total number of team members on the court cannot exceed four.
* Attacking the serve prohibited: players may not jump in order to contact the ball in order to send it over the net. Doing so will result in a point for the serving team. For advanced players, no first contact open handed serve returns allowed.
* Rosters are to be LOCKED the week prior to playoffs. Please ensure your team members listed here is your actual roster going into playoffs. Each player must be committed to a team and will only be allowed to play on that team throughout the playoffs. No NEW league players will be allowed for the playoffs. Any changes must be reviewed and approved by me prior to playoff day.

Generally, disputes should be resolved by coming to a consensus on how such plays will be called going forward and replaying the disputed point.

Remember we’re all out here to have a good time!
